# R-Programming-for-Bioinformatics

This repository is about understanding and applying R programming tools and techniques in the context of bioinformatics, genomics and biological data analysis.

## Repository Layout

This repository is structured in 11 Chapter Folders plus a Glossary Folder of biological and genomic terminology. Within each folder you have a set of R programs in R script (.R), R Markdown (.Rmd) and HTML format (.html). The files can be downloaded and the html files can be viewed in a web browser after downloading.
